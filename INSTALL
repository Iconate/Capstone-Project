How to install GGH
========================================

  Basics
  ------

    Building GGH is typically just the running of "make"
    
    Before you can build GGH, you need to have:
       1. C Compiler
       2. At least GSL-1.14
    
    Once install, run "make" in the trunk.

  Pre-requirements
  -----------------

    * C Compiler
        1. sudo apt-get update
        2. sudo apt-get install build-essential
        3. sudo apt-get install gcc


    * Installing GSL-1.14
	 (file downloaded from http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/gnu/gsl/)
	Under the Download folder gsl-1.14.tar.gz is located
    	    1. tar -xzf gsl-1.14.tar.gz
    	    2. cd gsl-1.14
    	    3. ./configure
    	    4.  make (if any problems are encountered type “make clean”)
            5.  sudo make install


  Pre-requirements
  -----------------
	For testing functions in the test folder, compile these using
		gcc -Wall -o <TEST> <TEST>.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
	where <TEST> is the file name.
